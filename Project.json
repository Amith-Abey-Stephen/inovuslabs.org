In this age of advanced technology, the persistence of this archaic process raises questions. The argument against this notion is further challenged by the secure email practices of banks and financial institutions. Additionally, the current method causes a massive influx of traffic to the website upon result publication, potentially overwhelming servers. The script emulates the manual steps of retrieving results, capturing screenshots for each result, and storing them in a designated folder",
